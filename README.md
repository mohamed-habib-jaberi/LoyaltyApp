# LoyaltyApp

A simple application to manage fidelity.

The goal is to start from a basic MVC project and transform it to a MVVM-C project

## Requirements

Flow is the one you would expect from a basic CRUD application.

Some particual elements are expected: 
- Signup screen is displayed in case a sign in failed (bad UX choice) with prefilled elements from the sign in screen
